He became a household name as Sherlock Holmes on the British television series Sherlock. He appeared in two Oscar-nominated films - War Horse and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He followed this with acclaimed roles in the science fiction fiction film Star Trek Into Darkness, the Oscar-winning drama Twelve Years a Slave, The Fifth Estate and August: Osage County. He portrayed Alan Turing in The Imitation Game which earned him a Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy of Film and Television Arts and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.</p>

            <p class="description">Her first multi-scene performance came in A Village Affair, an adaptation of the lesbian love story by Joanna Trollope.

The first time Keira's name was mentioned around the world was when it was revealed (in a plot twist kept secret by director George Lucas) that she played Natalie Portman's decoy "Padme" to Portman's "Amidala" in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.</p>

                <p class="description">Although Americans are most familiar with Strong's roles as Sinestro in Green Lantern, mob boss Frank D'Amico in Kick-Ass, and Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes, British audiences know him from his long history as a television actor. He also starred in as numerous British stage productions, including plays at the Royal National Theatre and the RSC.

He also played Mr. Knightley in the adaptation of Jane Austen's classic tale Emma.</p>
